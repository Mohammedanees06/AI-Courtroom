Evidence Supporting Side B (Defendant) – 5 Lines
1. Timestamped emails show the plaintiff approved the delay in advance.

This proves the plaintiff cannot later claim the delay was unexpected or harmful.

2. CCTV and digital logs confirm the defendant delivered their part exactly as agreed.

Directly contradicts the plaintiff’s claim of “non-performance.”

3. Bank statements reveal the plaintiff failed to make the second payment on time.

This shifts responsibility back to the plaintiff for breaching the agreement first.

4. Independent expert report shows the alleged damages were unrelated to the defendant’s actions.

Destroys the link between “defendant’s action” → “plaintiff’s loss.”

5. Witness testimonies verify that the plaintiff changed the project requirements halfway.

Proves the plaintiff caused delays and confusion, not the defendant.
